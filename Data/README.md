# Mask 
There are two mask file 'mask.mat' and 'mask_3d_shift.mat'. 
File 'mask.mat' is a 2D-version mask (660×660) which is the modulation corresponding to the first spectral channel out of 24 channels.
File 'mask_3d_shift.mat' is a 3D-version mask (660×706x24) in which each mask channel is the shift version of the first mask channel.
